Artificial intelligence is a discipline that studies the use of computers to simulate certain thinking processes and intelligent behaviors of people (such as learning, reasoning, thinking, planning, etc.), mainly including the principles of computer realization of intelligence and the manufacture of computers similar to human brain intelligence, so that computers can realize higher-level applications. Ai will involve disciplines such as computer science, psychology, philosophy and linguistics. It can be said that almost all disciplines of natural science and social science, its scope has far exceeded the scope of computer science, the relationship between artificial intelligence and thinking science is the relationship between practice and theory, artificial intelligence is in the technical application level of thinking science, is an application branch of it. From the perspective of thinking, artificial intelligence is not limited to logical thinking, to consider image thinking, inspiration thinking to promote the breakthrough development of artificial intelligence, mathematics is often considered to be the basic science of a variety of disciplines, mathematics has also entered the field of language, thinking, artificial intelligence disciplines must also borrow mathematical tools, mathematics not only in standard logic, fuzzy mathematics and other fields play a role. When mathematics enters the discipline of artificial intelligence, they will promote each other and develop faster.
